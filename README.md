# Predicting-Condominium-Sale-Prices

#### **Context and goal:**

In this project, we'll build multiple linear regression models to predict condominium sale prices for all five boroughs of New York City: Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island, and Queens. 

The purpose of our work is to find out how well the size of a condominium (measured in gross square feet) explain sale price across New York City as a whole and for each individual borough.

**Dataset:**

We'll use condominium sales data from all five boroughs of New York City. The datasets are publicly available [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page). 

These datasets contains all sales from April 2021 to March 2022.
